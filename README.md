The purpose of education has been a widely contested issue between the mainstream segment of the society and the sidelined yet vocal resistance to the centralized education system. The dissidents claim that it serves to create cogs to continue the machine of aristocratic rule of the hegemony; to create more soldiers, clerks, factory workers, etc. that can perform the tasks of social maintainence obediently and at the cost of keeping their potentials unrealized. To support their claims, they point towards the american pioneer who brought in the idea of mandatory schooling to USA Horace Mann based off of the Prussian Model of Education and then the Standardization of education curriculum by the committee of 1892 to uniformly create individuals capable of undergoing technical education in order to create what has been mentioned above; cogs.

The mainstream opposition's rebuttals are many, among which are access to free, public education being a basic human right, educaiton allows for an increase in the living standards of people by giving them the abilities to work for higher wages, etc. The contention between the two sides can be summarized by the following: Education is used as a factory to produce building blocks for the society so that the aristocracy can be maintained Vs education is used to build up the society to the individuals of the society can elevate their standards of living.

As one might guess, it is quite a conundrum for anyone to land a conclusion with either side. Thereby the purpose of this article is to analze premises that might guide our formulation of positions on this complex topic through correlations in the level of education attained among populations and different indicators for the success of society as well as the contentment of the individuals.

## Few insights:

As can be seen from the above graphs, the correlation between average years of secondary and tertiary education is atmost weak, even from the correlational value standards in a social science field.
